# Course overview

Offsecâ€™s Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP) certification is an advanced penetration testing course that builds on the knowledge and techniques taught in OSCP focusing specifcially on evasion techniques and bypassing defences within AD environments.

The course covers various topics, which some of them are:

- Client-Side Attacks.
- Process Injection and Migration.
- Antivirus Evasion.
- Application Allow-Listing.
- Bypassing Network Filters.
- Windows and Linux Lateral Movement.
- Active Directory Exploitation.
- Microsoft SQL Attacks.

Each topic is convered widely and Offsec did a pretty good job at explaning each one of them.<br>
Many people except a Red Teaming stuff in the course, while it's make sense, this is NOT red team course, it's just the next level of penetration testing after the OSCP.

# The Modules Labs

Each topic have it's own lab set-up, I highly suggest to do all the modules labs as they will help you to practice the studied materials by not just watching videos but by doing, which this is what the course is all about - hands on hacking. <br>
Every module has it's own extra mile which I again highly recommend to do aswell, as they will teach you beyond what the course will teach you, you will learn the basic usage of Win32 API's, and in my opinion it's your job to do some research beyond of what the course is focusing on.
