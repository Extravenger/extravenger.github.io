# OSEP Course Review

## Introduction

The **Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP)** course is designed for penetration testers who already have a solid foundation in offensive security. The course builds on the skills learned in OSCP and dives deeper into advanced attack techniques, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to expand their expertise.

In this post, I’ll be reviewing my experience with the course, the labs, and what I’ve learned throughout the journey. I’ll also share some of the challenges and highlights, so you can get a full picture of what to expect if you decide to take this course.

## Course Overview

The OSEP course is a **100% hands-on training** that covers a wide range of penetration testing techniques. The course focuses on **real-world attack scenarios** and requires practical skills to exploit systems, escalate privileges, and bypass security measures.

Some of the key topics covered include:
- **Web Application Attacks**: Advanced techniques for exploiting web applications.
- **Active Directory Attacks**: In-depth knowledge of Active Directory and how to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows environments.
- **Windows Privilege Escalation**: Detailed exploration of Windows environments and privilege escalation techniques.
- **Buffer Overflow Exploitation**: Understanding how to exploit buffer overflows on both Windows and Linux platforms.

The course structure is as follows:
- **Lecture Modules**: Informative and technical lectures explaining the tools, techniques, and methodologies.
- **Labs**: Hands-on exercises that simulate real-world penetration testing environments.
- **Final Exam**: A 24-hour exam where you apply everything you've learned to exploit a remote network.

## Labs: A Hands-On Experience

One of the best parts of the OSEP course is the **labs**. The labs are designed to replicate real-world environments, and each lab challenges you to solve complex problems using various tools and techniques. The course includes:
- **Active Directory Labs**: You will get access to Windows domains, where you’ll practice AD enumeration, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.
- **Web Application Labs**: You’ll be tasked with exploiting vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and remote code execution in various web apps.
- **Buffer Overflow Labs**: Learn how to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
- **Linux Labs**: You will explore different privilege escalation techniques on Linux systems.

The labs are not easy, but they are **extremely valuable** for building hands-on experience and testing your knowledge. Some labs might take several hours or days to complete, but that’s the fun and challenge of it!

## Key Skills Learned

Throughout the course, I’ve gained in-depth knowledge of the following key skills:

### 1. **Advanced Penetration Testing Techniques**
   - From **privilege escalation** to **post-exploitation**, I’ve learned how to fully compromise environments, pivot, and maintain access.
   
### 2. **Web Application Exploits**
   - Mastering **advanced SQL injection**, **XSS**, **file inclusion attacks**, and **RCE** exploits has helped me become much more effective in finding vulnerabilities in web apps.

### 3. **Windows & Active Directory Exploitation**
   - **Active Directory enumeration** and **Windows privilege escalation** are no longer daunting tasks. I learned how to **bypass security controls** and **exploit Windows vulnerabilities** effectively.
   
### 4. **Exploitation of Buffer Overflows**
   - I’ve gained a deeper understanding of **buffer overflow exploitation** on both Windows and Linux platforms, including techniques to develop shellcodes and exploit vulnerable applications.

### 5. **Scripting and Automation**
   - **Python** scripting and **automation** have become vital tools for me in the testing process. I’ve learned to write custom scripts for different attacks, which is incredibly useful for efficient penetration testing.

## Challenges Faced

Although the OSEP course is rewarding, it’s not without its challenges:
- **Time Management**: Some of the labs, especially those involving complex AD and web app attacks, can take a long time to complete. It’s important to manage time effectively and avoid frustration.
- **Advanced Content**: The course is **fast-paced** and assumes you already have experience in penetration testing. Some of the content is challenging, but it’s what makes the course worth it.
- **Exam Pressure**: The 24-hour exam is very challenging. You need to be well-prepared and comfortable working under pressure.

## Conclusion: Is OSEP Worth It?

If you’re an experienced penetration tester looking to level up your skills, the OSEP course is absolutely worth it. The hands-on labs provide valuable real-world experience, and the skills you acquire will make you a more effective and efficient penetration tester.

Personally, I feel much more confident in tackling **advanced security issues**, especially in **Active Directory environments**. The course not only deepened my knowledge of offensive security techniques but also equipped me with the tools to perform high-level penetration testing.

I highly recommend the **OSEP course** to anyone interested in advancing their career in cybersecurity. It’s challenging, but incredibly rewarding!

## Final Thoughts

As I look back on my OSEP journey, I’m grateful for the knowledge gained and the skills developed. Whether you’re looking to pass the exam or simply improve your penetration testing skills, this course is a fantastic investment.

Thank you for reading my review, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the course or my experience!
