# Course overview

Offsecâ€™s Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP) certification is an advanced penetration testing course that builds on the knowledge and techniques taught in OSCP focusing specifcially on evasion techniques and bypassing defences within AD environments.

The course covers various topics, which some of them are:

- Client-Side Attacks.
- Process Injection and Migration.
- Antivirus Evasion.
- Application Allow-Listing.
- Bypassing Network Filters.
- Windows and Linux Lateral Movement.
- Active Directory Exploitation.
- Microsoft SQL Attacks.

Each topic is convered widely and Offsec did a pretty good job at explaning each one of them.<br>
Many people except a Red Teaming stuff in the course, while it's make sense, this is NOT red team course, it's just the next level of penetration testing after the OSCP.

# The Modules Labs

Each topic has its own dedicated lab setup. I highly recommend completing all the lab exercises for each module, as they provide hands-on practice that reinforces the material, allowing you to learn by doing rather than just watching videos. After all, the essence of this course is hands-on hacking.

Each module also includes an extra mile section, which I strongly suggest you complete. These exercises go beyond the core curriculum, offering additional insights such as the basics of Win32 APIs. In my opinion, it's important to dive deeper and conduct research beyond the course's focus, as this will enhance your understanding and skills.
