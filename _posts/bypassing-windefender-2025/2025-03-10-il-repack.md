# ilrepack - What is it?

[ilrepack](https://github.com/gluck/il-repack) is a tool that allows you to merge multiple assemblies into a single assembly.<br>
This can be useful when you deploy an application that has a few dependencies. In this case, you can merge all the dll and the exe into a single exe file, so it's easier to deploy it. It's also useful if you create a NuGet package. In this case, it allows removing the dependencies that you don't want to expose to your consumers.

Although ilrepack is primarily used for legitimate purposes, what if I told you it could be used the other way around? That's right – imagine combining a legitimate file with a malicious one. Could this help evade detection? Let's find out.

In this blog post, we will explore how to obfuscate the well-known and powerful tool [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus), which is commonly used for Active Directory exploitation.

# Step 1: Start From The Basics

As with any obfuscation process, we’ll begin with the most basic techniques.<br> 
This involves cloning the source code of Rubeus, opening it in Visual Studio, and then changing some commonly used names like `Rubeus`  and `Rubeus.exe`:

Next, I'll remove the Rubeus version details from the `info.cs` file:

*Note: After making this change, be sure to remove `ShowLogo()` from all instances where it is used, as it no longer exists.*

Now, I will remove the whole comments from the solution using regex:

As the final step for this part, I will ensure that the `Assembly Name` and `Default Namespace` are changed to different values:

Although there are many other common strings detected by Windows Defender that we can modify, let's move on to the next step.

# Step 2: Changing the Metadata

To modify the metadata of the compiled file, we can use a tool like `Resource Hacker`. This allows us to edit properties such as:

- FileDescription
- Version
- Company Name
- Product Name
- Copyright
- Comments

I will open the compiled file with Resource Hacker and make the necessary changes:

I will save the file with a new name, `Rubeus-modified.exe`, so we can proceed.

# Step 3: Reassemble!

As for now, our binary is still detected by Windows Defender up to this point:

In the next step, we will use `ilrepack` to merge `Rubeus-modified.exe` binary with two DLL's: `System.dll` and `System.Web.dll`.<br>
*Note: You can install `ilrepack` with the following command: `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ilrepack`.*

If you have ilrepack installed, we can go ahead and merge the assemblies:

```powershell
ilrepack /out:AmitRubeus.exe Rubeus-modified.exe System.dll System.Web.dll /lib:"C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin" /lib:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\resources\app\ServiceHub\Services\Microsoft.VisualStudio.Setup.Service" /lib:"C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\9.0.200\DotnetTools\dotnet-format" /allowduplicateresources /zeropekind
```

Dropping and executing the newly created file on disk with the latest updated version of Windows Defender on Windows 11:

shows that we have successfully bypassed Windows Defender and Rubeus is working as intended.

# Final Thoughts

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how legitimate tools can be abused for malicious purposes.
ILRepack is one tool that can be leveraged for various purposes, with bypassing security solutions being one of them.<br>

Thanks for reading and go merge them all!
