# Microsoft Defender Evolution

In recent years, bypassing Microsoft Defender has been relatively straightforward, often only requiring minor modifications, such as changing common strings within a file, This simple approach allowed attackers to evade detection.<br>
However, from my perspective in 2025, I can confidently say that Windows Defender has significantly improved and now does a much better job of catching malicious files, scripts, and other threats.<br>
It has become far more effective at identifying and blocking potential threats, showcasing how the security landscape has evolved over time.

While there is always room for improvement, today I will demonstrate how legitimate tools can be misused for malicious purposes - one of which is bypassing Windows Defender in 2025. So, let’s dig right in.

# ilrepack Overview

[ilrepack](https://github.com/gluck/il-repack) is a tool that allows you to merge multiple assemblies into a single assembly.<br>
This can be useful when you deploy an application that has a few dependencies.<br>
In this case, you can merge all the DLL and the EXE into a single EXE file, so it's easier to deploy it.

Although ilrepack is primarily used for legitimate purposes, what if I told you it could be used the other way around?<br>
That's right – imagine combining a legitimate file with a malicious one. Could this help evade detection? Let's find out.

In this blog post, we will explore how to obfuscate the well-known and powerful tool [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus), which is commonly used for Active Directory exploitation.

# Step 1: Start From The Basics

As with any obfuscation process, we’ll begin with the most basic techniques.<br> 
This involves cloning the source code of Rubeus, opening it in Visual Studio, and then changing some commonly used names like `Rubeus`  and `Rubeus.exe`:

Next, I'll remove the Rubeus version details from the `info.cs` file:

*Note: After making this change, be sure to remove `ShowLogo()` from all instances where it is used, as it no longer exists.*

Now, I will remove the whole comments from the solution using regex:

As the final step for this part, I will ensure that the `Assembly Name` and `Default Namespace` are changed to different values:

Although there are many other common strings detected by Windows Defender that we can modify, let's move on to the next step.

# Step 2: Changing the Metadata

To modify the metadata of the compiled file, we can use a tool like `Resource Hacker`.<br>
This allows us to edit properties such as:

- FileDescription
- Version
- Company Name
- Product Name
- Copyright
- Comments

I will open the compiled file with Resource Hacker and make the necessary changes:

I will save the file with a new name, `Rubeus-modified.exe`, so we can proceed.

# Step 3: Reassemble!

As for now, our binary is still detected by Windows Defender up to this point:

In the next step, we will use `ilrepack` to merge `Rubeus-modified.exe` binary with two DLL's: `System.dll` and `System.Web.dll`.<br>
*Note: You can install `ilrepack` with the following command: `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ilrepack`.*

If you have ilrepack installed, we can go ahead and merge the assemblies:

```powershell
ilrepack /out:AmitRubeus.exe Rubeus-modified.exe System.dll System.Web.dll /lib:"C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin" /lib:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\resources\app\ServiceHub\Services\Microsoft.VisualStudio.Setup.Service" /lib:"C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\9.0.200\DotnetTools\dotnet-format" /allowduplicateresources /zeropekind
```

Dropping and executing the newly created file on disk with the latest updated version of Windows Defender on Windows 11:

shows that we have successfully bypassed Windows Defender and Rubeus is working as intended.

# Final Thoughts

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding how legitimate tools can be abused for malicious purposes.<br>
Tools that were initially designed to serve legitimate functions can often be exploited to bypass or defeat security measures - 
ilrepack is just one example of such a tool, While it was created for merging assemblies and improving the performance of .NET applications, attackers can leverage its capabilities to manipulate files in ways that evade detection from security solutions.<br>
This ability to repurpose a legitimate tool for malicious ends highlights the ever-evolving nature of cybersecurity threats and the creative ways in which they are carried out.

Thanks for reading!

Now, go ahead and start merging - stay sharp, stay creative, and keep pushing the boundaries!
