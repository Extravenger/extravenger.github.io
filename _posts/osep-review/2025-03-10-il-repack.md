# ilrepack Overview

[ILRepack](https://github.com/gluck/il-repack) is a tool that allows you to merge multiple assemblies into a single assembly.<br>
This can be useful when you deploy an application that has a few dependencies. In this case, you can merge all the dll and the exe into a single exe file, so it's easier to deploy it. It's also useful if you create a NuGet package. In this case, it allows removing the dependencies that you don't want to expose to your consumers.

Although ILRepack is primarily used for legitimate purposes, what if I told you it could be used the other way around? That's right – imagine combining a legitimate file with a malicious one. Could this help evade detection? Let's find out.<br>
In this blog post, we will explore how to obfuscate the well-known and powerful tool Rubeus, which is commonly used for Active Directory exploitation.

# Start From The Basics

As with any obfuscation process, we’ll begin with the most basic techniques.<br> 
This involves cloning the source code of Rubeus, opening it in Visual Studio, and then changing some commonly used names—starting with the word "Rubeus."
